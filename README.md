js-py-proto
===========

Javascript library to bring your favorite Python built-ins to the web.


Being a full-stack developer, I often find myself wishing that native Javascript entities had a bit more functionality.
In particular, I have written a few functions here and there that I come to expect because of python built-ins.

So, I decided to make a project where I can take that idea to the next level and aim to implement as many python built-ins in Javascript as I can.
